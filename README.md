Automatic Bottle Filling Machine
An Arduino-based Automatic Bottle Filling System designed to automate the process of positioning bottles, dispensing liquids, and resetting the system for the next cycle. The project utilizes limit switches, a relay-operated motor for linear motion, and a servo motor for dispensing.

Features:
1. Automatic detection of bottle position using a limit switch
2. Linear motion system to align bottles under the funnel
3. Servo motor controlled dispensing system
4. Relay control for forward and backward motor motion

Components Used
1. Arduino Mega 2560
2. Servo Motor (for controlling funnel outlet)
3. DC Motor with Gear and Rack (for bottle movement)
4. Relay Module
5. Limit Switch
6. Power Supply
7. Plastic Funnel
8. Cups (bottles)
9. Jumper wires
10. Breadboard
11. Base board
